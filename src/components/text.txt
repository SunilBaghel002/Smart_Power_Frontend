🌟 Proud Moment 🌟



I’m excited to share that our team secured 1st position 🏆 in the Internal Smart India Hackathon (SIH) held at Aravali College of Engineering and Management, competing among 25 talented teams!



Our project aims at a sustainable solution – producing electricity from footsteps and vehicle movement using piezoelectric sensors. These sensors are embedded into specially designed eco-bricks made from recycled plastic, sand/dust, and resin, addressing both clean energy generation and waste management. 



This achievement wouldn’t have been possible without the amazing efforts of my teammates:

 👥 Satyam Pandey | Aryan Kumar | Apoorva Sharma | Dev Shekhawat | Anuj Dubey



A huge thanks to our mentors 🙏Ms. Rashika Singh, Dr. Ashif ali, for their constant guidance and encouragement, and to Aravali College of Engineering and Management for providing us with this wonderful platform to showcase our ideas.

We’re motivated to take this idea forward and create a real-world impact through innovation and teamwork. 🚀
